# DTrace mode

[DTrace][dtrace] script mode.

Originally written by Alexander Kolbasov.

## Don't submit this to MELPA

Please don't submit this repo to [MELPA][melpa] because there is
already a mode called [d-mode.el][d-mode] for a different D language
that has nothing to do with DTrace.

The above issue is solved, now all that's outstanding is the licensing
issue.

## Next steps

1. Wait for **Alexander Kolbasov** to approve the license
1. ~~Resolve the name clash between this package's name and the [other][d-mode] mode~~
1. Submit to [MELPA][melpa] once the issues above are solved
