# DTrace mode

## Why is this here?

Because I couldn't find DTrace mode available in any repository.

I looked around for the DTrace mode for Emacs and all I could find was
[this][mode-post] mail thread by **Alexander Kolbasov**.

I'm now in touch with Alexander Kolbasov... stay tuned.

## Don't submit this to MELPA

Please don't submit this repo to [MELPA][melpa] because there is
already a mode called [d-mode.el][d-mode] for a different D language
that has nothing to do with DTrace.

The above issue is solved, now all that's outstanding is the licensing
issue.

## Next steps

1. Get hold of **Alexander Kolbasov** and ask him what license this conde should be released under
1. ~~Resolve the name clash between this package's name and the [other][d-mode] mode~~
1. Submit to [MELPA][melpa] once the issues above are solved
